## Rachel & Jer
This is a small, static website that I built for my proposal, and then my wedding on October 24, 2020.

For my proposal, it showed a simple timeline of my then fiance and I's dating journey. This was a great segway into presenting the ring :)

Later, I modified it to host a link to our livestream (because of covid-19 restrictions in Toronto).

The website is not currently hosted.

To run locally, clone and run `yarn start`.
